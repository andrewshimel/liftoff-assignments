## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a searchable collection of Missouri Wildlife. Effectively, I want to be able to look up information on local animals based on broad traits and learn info about them. For the scope of this course I have decided to break it down into tags, which can help show you associated wildlife as well as other traits of the animal, such as whether or not it is venomous, etc. I am an avid fan of finding out cool new info about the living world around me and would like to create an application that aids others in that as well.

The project's initial features will be minimal and allow for entries and tags to be added. Further features are inevitable but for the immediate feature allowing a validated administrator account to add/edit entries, as well as allowing the user to search by tags or names are the primary goals.
